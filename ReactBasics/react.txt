 # we only had html css and js

 #then jquery came and help us in wiritng js files easily

 #then backbone.js came and help us to maintain large no. of js files 

 #then we have spa(single page application) => only one page .(ajax)
(now what happened was ,we dont have to open new html file again and again our js file will change the html and css as per requirments)

2010=> Angular.js - now we can make everythin gin different containers  and which leads to the MVC -MODEL VIEW CONSTROLLER OR MVVM
PROBLEM WITH Angular:- The complexity increased ,it becomes difficult to maintain such large number of people ,as the structure becomes complex .

And thus Facebook developers came into picture as it became difficult to maintain Facebook .


2013=> Facebook came up with the REACT (that has a different method to make a javascript project)

2014=> Angular.js becomes Angular 

Babel=> allows us to to run same react code on different explorers like Google,E-explorers,safari etc.

Webpack=>takes js files and implement them inspit of differnet versions
